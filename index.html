## Workflow for Certifying Your Plugin with Red Hat Developer Hub

#### This document outlines the steps required to certify your plugin with Red Hat Developer Hub. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth and successful certification process.

### 1. Submit Your Plugin for Certification

1. Fork the Certification Repository to your GitHub account.
    
2. Prepare a Certification Pull Request

   Create a directory under `partner` with the name of your organization. 
   
   Inside this directory, create a subdirectory with the name of your dynamic plugin. 
   
   Within this plugin directory, create another subdirectory using the version of the plugin as the directory name. 
   
   Finally, in this version directory, create a file called `package.yaml`.

   In the `package.yaml` file, add the content for your dynamic plugin. Below is an example structure and content:

   **Directory Structure:**
   ```plaintext
   partner/
   └── your-organization
       └── your-plugin
           └── v1.0.0
               └── package.yaml
   ```
    

   **Example `package.yaml` Content:**
   ```yaml
   global:
     dynamic:
       plugins:
         - package: oci://quay.io/tkral/backstage-community-plugin-todo:v0.1.1!backstage-community-plugin-todo
           disabled: false
   ```

3. Submit the PR:

    * Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request against the certification repository.

### 2. Certification Pipeline

1. Automated CI/CD Pipeline:

    * Your plugin will automatically be run through the certification pipeline:
        - Compatibility checks with Red Hat Developer Hub.

    * Incorporate feedback from reviewers.

### 3. Post-Certification
